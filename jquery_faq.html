        <p>YellowStone Country Montana</p>
        <button id="toggle-visibility">Visible</button>

        <dl>
            <dt>How do I get there?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Three of the five entrances to Yellowstone National Park are located in Montana’s Yellowstone Country; they can be accessed through West Yellowstone, Gardiner and Cooke City, MT.</dd>

            <dt>Is the park open year-round?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">The park is open all year, but not all of the roads are open to motorized vehicles during the winter, which makes it a magical time to visit. Snowcoach and snowmobile tours are offered, and the steaming hot pots and geysers are even more dramatic against the cold wintry landscape. Fewer people visit in the winter, which gives it a different feel—the quietness is uncanny.</dd>

            <dt>What animals can I expect to see?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">While we can’t guarantee wildlife sightings, Yellowstone is home to the largest concentration of mammals in the United States, so your chances of spotting some are pretty good. There are 67 species of mammals living in the park, including black bears and grizzly bears. You will most likely see bison, elk, deer and possibly bears. For those willing to get up early, you may be lucky enough to spot a wolf.</dd>

            <dt>Can you stay in the park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Yes, and we highly recommend it! Immersing yourself in the essence of the park gives a whole different perspective. Taking the time to experience the area over a few days is well worth it. There are nine lodging options in the summer, ranging from the most famous Old Faithful Inn to rustic cabins, or one of the newly renovated rooms in the elegant Lake Yellowstone Hotel.</dd>

            <dt>What can I do besides scenic driving?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Simply put, a lot. While scenic drives, photography and wildlife watching are the most popular activities in the park, exploration is endless. Adventurers can hike, fish, bike, horseback ride and boat. For those who prefer a more educational experience, sign up for a Ranger Program or seasonal talks. Yellowstone also offers a number of youth programs and activities.</dd>

            <dt>Can I get food, gas and supplies inside the park?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Gas, snacks and restaurants are all available within the park, but there is not a full-service grocery store. Gas pumps are available at Canyon, Fishing Bridge, Grant Village, Mammoth</dd>

            <dt>Does the park have cell service and internet connections?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Cell phone service is limited, but available at Old Faithful, Yellowstone Lake, Canyon, Grant and Mammoth Hot Springs Villages. Wireless internet can be purchased at select locations within these area lodges.</dd>

            <dt>Can I bring pets?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Yes, you can bring your pet, and if you are staying in the park, the cabin accommodations allow for this. However, there are restrictions to consider. Wildlife is dangerous and pets must be kept on a leash at all times. Pets are not allowed on trails or boardwalks, in the backcountry or in thermal areas. You must not leave your pet unattended or tied to an object. If you’re headed into the backcountry, a permit is also required for your pet. We’re not saying don’t bring them, but it may not be as much fun for your furry loved ones as it is for you.</dd>

            <dt>What kind of clothes should I bring?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">Weather changes rapidly in the Rocky Mountains, so plan to bring a variety of layers. Spring and fall weather can turn from warm sunshine to a small snowstorm in the same day. Summer days average 70 – 80 degrees, but temperatures drop to 30 – 40 degrees at night. Afternoon thunderstorms are common. It may seem out of season, but hats and gloves are good to have on hand.</dd>

            <dt>Do I need special licenses or permits?</dt>
            <dd class="invisible">In addition to entrance fees, certain activities do require a permit. Fishing, backcountry hiking and camping, boating, research and commercial photography all need a permit. A special permit must also be obtained for large gatherings such as weddings or other public assemblies.</dd>
